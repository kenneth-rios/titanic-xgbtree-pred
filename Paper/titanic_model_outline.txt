Predictors
pclass, title (extracted from name, then grouped), sex, age, age**2 (diminishing returns?), 
sibsp, parch, family ID (grouped by unique ticket #s), fare, and embarked. Don't include 
a dummy for presence of body number since it is correlated with survived only 
because it occurs post-mortem and thus has nothing to do with the actual probability 
of survival. Maybe use first letter of cabin and bin missing values using the average cabin 
level of the passenger class.

Use family ID to control for within-family variation~


Imputation
How to impute missing values for Age (as a continuous variable) using the ENTIRE data
Either:
1). use -mice- package (see 'methods'), or
2). use caret's predict(preProcess = "knnImpute"/"bagImpute")*, or 
3). apply lambda: conditional median estimator, or
4). allow xgboost to handle NAs? (probably not, there are way too many NAs...)
Then generate Age**2


Model
Using R's -caret- (using factors for categorical predictors except for "xgboost").
Either use:
1). Logistic Regression "glm" (including additional interaction term between
age and sex), or
--
2). Random Forest "ranger"/"rf" (which already models interactions between predictors), or
--
3). (Stochastic) Gradient Boosted Trees "gbm", or
4). Regularized Gradient Boosting "xgboost"* (see References)
