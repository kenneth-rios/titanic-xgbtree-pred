Variable Notes
pclass: A proxy for socio-economic status
1st = Upper
2nd = Middle
3rd = Lower

age: Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5

name: In the case of married women, it appears that the name in parenthesis is the 
      passenger's name, and the name before the parenthesis is the husband's name. This 
      would explain why the majority of these are female.
      	If the name in parenthesis is also enclosed in quotation marks, then it appears to 
      be an alias or nickname. For example, Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon and his wife were 
      Mr. and Mrs. Morgan.

cabin: First class had the top decks (A-E), second class (D-F), and third class (E-G). 
       It also makes sense that the people towards the top (higher decks, higher pclass) 
       more likely survived, because they were closer to the lifeboats.

sibsp: The dataset defines family relations in this way:
	sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
	spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fiancés were ignored)

parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way:
	parent = mother, father
	child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
	some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
